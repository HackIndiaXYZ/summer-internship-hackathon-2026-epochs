## Main Technical Features

### 1. Dual-Role Authentication & Security Guards
* **Smart Signup Router:** Interactive signup selector lets users enroll as a **Student** or **Corporate Recruiter**. During recruiter registration, it captures enterprise details like Company Name.
* **Layout Security Guards:** Role-based redirection is built directly into parent Next.js layouts (`/dashboard/layout.tsx` and `/company-dashboard/layout.tsx`). If a recruiter lands on a student page, they are instantly redirected back to their corporate dashboard, and vice-versa, with zero content flickering.

### 2. Recruiter Student Discovery & Handshakes
* **High-Readiness Rosters:** Renders student scholars ordered dynamically by their Job Readiness indices and Achievements scores in Firestore.
* **Fuzzy Filtering:** Text-search queries filter students on-the-fly client-side by full name or specific competencies.
* **Integrated Handshake Modals:** Recruiters can send personalized connection requests. This writes a pending invitation document in the main `connections` collection.
* **Real-time Handshake Notifications:** Students instantly receive a visual notification badge in their header. Under `/dashboard/notifications`, they can view recruiter messages and click **Accept Invitation** or **Decline**, which syncs back to the database in real-time.

### 3. Active Resume Metrics Syncer & AI Parser
* **Student Upload Portal:** On their profile, students can select or drop `.pdf`, `.doc`, or `.docx` resume files.
* **AI Parser Simulation:** Shows a gorgeous, step-by-step progress animation simulating semantic parsing on our AI engine. The file metadata is persisted directly to their Firestore profile.
* **Recruiter Resume Viewer:** Recruiters can click **View Synced Resume** on any student card to open a custom visualizer modal summarizing the candidate's education, matched skills, and an active PDF download link.

### 4. 100% Mobile Responsive Fluid Layouts
* **Slide-Out Sidebars:** Sidebars automatically compress into hidden layouts and slide smoothly into view with custom gestures or hamburger taps on mobile viewports.
* **Backdrop Dimming:** Opening menus on tablets or mobile phones displays a blurred backdrop shadow (`backdrop-blur-sm bg-slate-950/60`). Tapping anywhere outside the menu slides it back out of view.
* **Fluid Padding grids:** Grid content areas scale dynamically from phone screens (`p-4`) up to widescreen monitors (`p-8`).

## Installation & Local Setup

### Prerequisites & Secrets Configuration

Create a `.env` file inside the `/backend` directory:
```env
PORT=5000
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

### Running the Full-Stack Workspace

Launch both layers in separate terminal instances:

#### 1. Start the Express Gateway (Backend)
```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the server in hot-reload watch mode
npm run dev
```
*The API gateway will listen on: **`http://localhost:5000`***

#### 2. Start the React/Next.js Client (Frontend)
```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the Next.js development server
npm run dev
```
*The SkillBridge client interface will launch on: **`http://localhost:3000`***

---

## Compilation, Quality, & Type-Safety

To run static builds and confirm strict compilation with zero TypeScript errors:
```bash
cd frontend
npx tsc --noEmit
```
Both layers are guaranteed to compile with **`exit-code 0`**!
